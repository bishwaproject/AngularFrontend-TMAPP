# AngularFrontend-TMAPP
Angular Frontend for Task Management App which has SpringBoot Backend. Using both technologies together, where Java EE (SpringBoot) handles the backend and Angular handles the frontend. This approach allows for a clear separation of concerns and enables you to leverage the strengths of both technologies.


## Angular
Angular, is a popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic single-page web applications. It is a client-side framework that runs in the browser and provides a rich set of tools and features for building interactive UI(S). Angular follows a component-based architecture and uses TypeScript as its programming language.
It offers features like data binding, dependency injection, routing, and reusable UI components.
It provides a powerful and feature-rich environment for building dynamic single-page applications. You can use Angular to create the UI components, handle user interactions, and consume RESTful API(S) provided by Spring Boot backed.
##### Option (Thymeleaf): 
Thymeleaf is a server-side java template engine that can be used with Spring Boot. It allows you to generate dynamic HTML pages on the server and send them to the client. Thymeleaf provides seamless integration with Spring Boot and is a good choice if your prefer server-side rendering.

#### Option (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
We can also use traditional web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We can create Static or dynamic web pages and use JavaScript to handle client-side interactions. In this case, your Spring Boot backend would provide RESTful API(S) for data exchange.
